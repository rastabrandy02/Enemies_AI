# Introduction to the Artificial Inteligence
In videogames, the artificial intelligence is used to generate responsive behaviours against certain situations in non playable characters. It is mainly used to improve the game-player experience rather than machine-learning (but it can also be used).
The AI in videogames was popularized during the arcade golden age of arcade games, making different difficulty levels, alternate movement patterns and in-game events driven by the player actions. 
Modern games use AI to implement pathfinding, decision trees, data-mining and procedural content generation.
For the artificial intelligence of the enemies is very common to use some type of state machine, this way it's easier to manage the behaviour of these entities depending on the current state of the game.
# Combat archetypes
In this section we will review the different archetypes of RPG enemies that you can find and their main characteristics. 
## Agressive
This archetype of enemy is the most common one. They usually have low life pool and low damage because their main function is to fill the battle. They will attack without any special priority and they don't usually cast special abilities or magic skills.
## Anti-Tank
Those enemies are designed to melt the characters with more health or defenses, they usually have a large life pool and strong single-target attacks. They usually priorize attacking the tanks of the party but they are not restringed to these targets.
The anti-tanks are usually enemies with some crowd control or altered state weakness because the player is intended to leave these enemies out of combat for some turns while they focus in higher priority targets.
## Tank
The tanks are enemies with high life pools, resistances or defensive skills. Some of them have also the ability to drive the attention of the party to them, leaving the high priority enemy targets alive.
## Assasin
This archetype of character is characterized by their high damage output, usually targeting characters with low hp/defenses with single target attacks. If the player doesn't focus on these enemies soon enough they might become a serious threat, specially for the mages and healers.
## Caster
The casters have low life pools and high damage attacks. They use multi-target skills often so they can drain the life and mana of the whole party in a couple of turns. 
Also, if they are combined with other archetypes, can become a serious threat as they weaken the characters while others finish them.
## Support
The supports are identified by their healing and buffing abilities, making the rest of the enemies more difficult to beat. They have low life pools and almost never attack directly but they are designed to be a high priority target for the player because leaving untouched might transform an easy encounter into a really hard battle.
## Spawner
The spawners have the ability of calling more monsters into battle and they will make that for the most part, attacking once in a while or when the battle is full of monsters. They usually have low life pools so the player can burst the spawners to stop the reinforcements.
## Merger
They usually have low life pools and damage. Their main characteristic is that they will attack or call more monsters of the same type into battle at a similar rate. If the number of monsters reaches a certain amount, they can merge into a more powerful enemy. The player is expected to kill the little mergers faster than they appear and use multi target skills to contain the reinforcement rate to prevent the strong enemy from appearing.
## Reward
These enemies have high life pools/defenses and their probability to flee is very high. The main characteristic of this archetype is the reward they give when slain (gold, xp, items...). Those characteristics make the reward enemies a high priority target because the player wants to beat them before they flee, increasing intrisically the difficulty of the battle just because the party is not focusing the rest of enemies.
